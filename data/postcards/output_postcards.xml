<message>Pediatrics Wing officially closed today. The mural of jungle animals seems to weep under peeling paint. Tiny handprints still mark the windows where children pressed against glass, watching birds we promised would mean spring's arrival.
With medical concern,

<message>Found these in what remained of your uniform. The blood is gone but the shrapnel dents remain - like your stubbornness. PT at 3pm. I put Army stickers on your walker.

<message>Married Omar yesterday in civil ceremony. No zaffeh procession, just two witnesses from refugee center. His family sends blessings from Turkey. We combined traditions - I wore blue for Syrian brides, he gave German gold ring. Strange to build love atop so much loss.
Bittersweet,

<message>The Halal food package arrived today - first proper hummus in 6 months! I ate the whole container remembering Mama's recipe. Found a mosque where people speak Arabic. They say Germany gets easier after first winter. The cold enters bones here but at least no bombs.
Stay safe,

<message>I passed by our old school today. The chalkboards still bear fragments of lessons from that final June. The swings creak like ghosts of children's laughter. Fifty years vanish in the dust motes dancing through broken windows.
With heavy regards,

<message>$500 sent today - tear down that zinc roof before rainy season! I work two cleaning jobs but never as hard as you in fields. The señora's kids call me "nanny" though I'm younger than them. One day you'll visit my own apartment, promise.

<message>The lifeboat returned alone today. We recovered no survivors this time. The harbor bells tolled seventeen times - once for each soul lost to the storm's hunger.
