      from James "Mac" MacAllister to
      Inspector Luis Gutierrez,
      City Safety Office.
    
    
      Fixed every harness issue you flagged. Showed the crew your cousin's accident photos - no more complaints about safety checks. You probably saved lives this week.
      Stay vigilant,
      Mac (55th St. site)
