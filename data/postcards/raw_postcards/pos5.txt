Memorandum dated 18-Apr-2023
from Dr. L. Chen to
Health Authority,
Birmingham.
Pediatrics Wing officially closed today. The mural of jungle animals seems to weep under peeling paint. Tiny handprints still mark the windows where children pressed against glass, watching birds we promised would mean spring's arrival.
With medical concern,
Dr. Chen
