Correspondence dated 03/11/22
from Mr. Albert Graves to
St. Mary's Alumni Association,
York.
I passed by our old school today. The chalkboards still bear fragments of lessons from that final June. The swings creak like ghosts of children's laughter. Fifty years vanish in the dust motes dancing through broken windows.
With heavy regards,
Albert
