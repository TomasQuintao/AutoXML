Mailed 22 June 2024
from Layla to
Parents,
Damascus, Syria.
Married Omar yesterday in civil ceremony. No zaffeh procession, just two witnesses from refugee center. His family sends blessings from Turkey. We combined traditions - I wore blue for Syrian brides, he gave German gold ring. Strange to build love atop so much loss.
Bittersweet,
Layla
