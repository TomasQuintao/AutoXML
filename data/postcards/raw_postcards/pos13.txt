Brothers,
Aleppo, Syria.
The Halal food package arrived today - first proper hummus in 6 months! I ate the whole container remembering Mama's recipe. Found a mosque where people speak Arabic. They say Germany gets easier after first winter. The cold enters bones here but at least no bombs.
Stay safe,
Ahmed
